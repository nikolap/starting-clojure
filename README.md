# Starting Clojure

Setting up your environment to work in a new language ought to be straightforward and not a roadblock for a learner. The aim of this project is to provide step-by-step resources for any newcomer to Clojure(script) to get set up in their preferred development environment.

These resources ought to emphasize no preference for one OS or IDE over any other. They attempt to provide the very basics to getting a working environment set up in the fewest steps. There is some room to discuss alternatives, additional configurations, and other quality of life items in each environment, but this is not the focus.

A live version of this website and documents is available [here](http://www.startingclojure.com/)

## Contributing

First off, thank you!

Second, if you're wondering where to start, contributing to any of the following guides for IDE setup below would be a great start. Each IDE has a markdown file under resources/docs/.

### Outstanding Guides

- IntelliJ / Cursive (MacOS and Windows missing)
- Eclipse / Counterclockwise
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- VS Code
- Vim 
- Emacs

Third, if you have any contributions specific to Clojurescript setup those are also welcome! This could include things like cljsbuild or figwheel setup, REPL integration, or anything else that comes to mind. You're free to create a new markdown file in the docs directory.

Lastly, we could also use a collection of learning Clojure resources people could refer to once they are done setting up their environment or would like to learn more. Plenty of these already exist out in the wild, but it would be nice to either point to one here or curate our own.
